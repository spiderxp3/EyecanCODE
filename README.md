## 🔭 &nbsp; <span style="color: #f2cf4a; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.4em;">About this Project
</span>

>It is estimated that at least 200,000 children in India have severe visual impairment or blindness. During the pandemic, while we are sitting in our homes grasping numerous technological skills along with our daily education, the life of the visually-impaired youth has come to stillness like never before. **Team Dream Makers brings to you “Eye Can Code” a project which will help the visually impaired set forth a step in the colossal coding world.**

>>Bridging the gap between the visually impaired and the technological world, **Eye Can Code** is an initiative that takes the visually impaired on an expedition of programming by transcending voice into vision.
